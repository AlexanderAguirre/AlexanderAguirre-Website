        <div class="subheading mb-5">Music Major</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Alexander Aguirre and I am a 3rd year music major at the University of California, Riverside. I have an extensive background in music starting from the wide array of instruments that I play. I not only sing, but I also play piano, violin, and percussive instruments that aide each other when it comes to performing and practicing. To introduce my experiences on each instrument, I will start off with the one I have played the longest, the violin. I have played the violin for 14 years and have learned so much from the amount of patience and dedication it takes to learn such an instrument. My violin skills have allowed me to play with very many prestigious groups such as the San Bernardino County Orchestra, UCR Orchestra, and my own High Schools exceptionally talented Orchestra, Henry J. Kaiser High School. Following that, I took in interest in percussion in high school and I eventually flourished as a percussionist. I would go on to play percussion for groups such as marching band on tenor and snare drums, concert band on a multitude of instruments, and wind ensemble. Voice comes next with an impressive list of merits starting with performing with the UCR Chamber Singers. Following that group is the CBU associated choir titled the Gary Bonner Singers who would travel and perform in churches all over the Inland Empire. Next is a musical production I was involved in titled “The Sound of Music” which was hosted by La Sierra University. Following the same vein of musical production and singing; I was also a vocal duet contestant in the Riverside’s Got Talent contest sponsored by the Uptown Kiwanis Club. Finally, we come to piano which is a new but exciting venture for me that I am quickly growing in. Trained initially as a classical pianist, I decided to transition into more jazz repertoire that I enjoy very much.<br><br>

        Although I play all these instruments, my main focus in vocal performance. I am trained classically through a very experienced private teacher by the name of Dr. Ralph Cato. With lessons from him, I have been able to transition from a person of no knowledge of vocal performance or musicianship to a well-respected vocalist among my peers and professors. Training with Dr. Cato has taught to utilize every aspect of my voice from projecting to breathing correctly. This practice has caused exponential growth in my singing capabilities and it will only continue to grow as I am faced with harder repertoire and my opportunities for me to sing.<br><br>

        What I have learned at UCR is a number of incredible things that I will take with me through my career. The information of music theory and counterpoint have also aided me in moments of compositional bursts of energy in which I bring forth this abundance of knowledge shared with me to create something special. The tools provided for me through all my experiences and classes have helped me create a foundation for success.
